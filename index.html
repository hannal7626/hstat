            At the High School of Telecommunication Arts and Technology we adhere to a few core values:  students  are encouraged to continually challenge themselves; all members of our community work collaboratively to model a growth mindset  and to be accountable for fostering genuine respect, confidence, and the ongoing pursuit of knowledge; we are lifelong learners who build communities and encourage each other to be our personal best;  our work is to prepare students to be curious, independent learners and critical thinkers who question and investigate so that they are equipped to address both local and global challenges; and to always be kind, be kind, be kind.
